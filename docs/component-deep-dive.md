# Component Deep Dive

## SpectraStrike

SpectraStrike provides deterministic wrapper execution with policy enforcement, attestation metadata, and signed execution telemetry. It acts as the trust anchor for offensive activity provenance.

## VectorVue

VectorVue ingests signed telemetry, validates schema and provenance, correlates events into assurance narratives, and exposes validated evidence to operational and governance consumers.

## Integration Contract

The integration contract between SpectraStrike and VectorVue is built on canonical event schemas, execution fingerprint continuity, and cryptographic signature verification.
